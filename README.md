# Web-O-Pedia
This Project is based on Full-Stack-Web-Development and developed in GEU Grafest 2017 Competition with my team member from scratch in 24 hrs Limit. This application is useful for an organisation for generating Members ID card and generate ticket for Verification and crowd monitoring.
I would like to say special thanks to my teammate Aman Negi and Tanishi Jain for their hard work.
